_Fix the Clock_ is an extension of the earlier microgame. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to take the clock face that you set in Playgrounds, and have it run on the iPhone Simulator or your own iPhone! Also, you'll learn how to use the full Xcode interface and navigate through it's project files.

# Getting started

To begin this tutorial, first download the starter code project from [here](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Intro-Clock-App-Swift-Starter/archive/master.zip).

Once you've downloaded the starter project, double-click the `.zip` file to _extract_ the project folder. Open up the extracted folder and double-click `Clock.xcodeproj` so we can get started!
