_Fix the Clock_ is an extension of the lesson in the Make School CSP Variables course. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to take the clock face that you set in Playgrounds, and have it run on the iPhone Simulator or your own iPhone device! Also, you'll learn how to navigate through the Xcode interface and navigate through project files.

## Prerequisites

To begin this tutorial, first download the starter code project, available on Github [here](https://github.com/yariza/Clock-Xcode).

TODO: Add blurb about requirements for Apple account to develop on phone.

Once you've downloaded the starter project, open up `Clock.xcodeproj`, and we're ready to start!
